Material Weather Icons are rough “alternatives” for some of the Google Now Weather icons. 

As I couldn’t find any similar icon pack (except payed ones) I considered making them myself. They’re not perfect, I made them by eye, so no hate pls.

And off course if you like them feel free to use them and do whatever you like. Cheers.
